# Teration Operator
```
let result = 3 ^^ 4;  // Tetration: 3 raised to the power of 3 raised to the power of 3 raised to the power of 3
console.log(result);   // Output: 3 ^ (3 ^ (3 ^ 3))
```
Or:
```
let result = Math.tetration(3, 4);  // Tetration: 3 raised to the power of 3 raised to the power of 3 raised to the power of 3
console.log(result);   // Output: 3 ^ (3 ^ (3 ^ 3))
```
